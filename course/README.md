# Course

Information for participants of the hackathon: how we work, how progress is tracked and how the results are evaluated.

## Meeting

During the hackathon we use this Google Meet room:

**https://meet.google.com/qca-ueup-nmr**

## Ground rules

- **Everything in English:** code, comments, commit messages, issues, pull requests and documentation.
- **AI first:** use AI agents for as much of the work as possible.
- **Your own folder:** each team works only in its own folder under `games/` (`games/team-1/`, `games/team-2/`, ...).

## Teams

Every issue and pull request carries exactly one team label:

| Label               | Who               | Folder          |
|---------------------|-------------------|-----------------|
| `team-1` … `team-4` | the game teams    | `games/team-N/` |
| `platform`          | the platform team | `server/`       |
| `team-instructor`   | the instructors   | `course/`       |

## Project boards

Every team has its own GitHub Project with the issues and pull requests that carry its label. The boards are also listed on the repository's **Projects** tab. Issues and PRs are added to the boards by their team label, so label your work correctly.

| Board | Contents |
|---|---|
| [team-1](https://github.com/users/nd2003/projects/2) | issues and PRs labeled `team-1` |
| [team-2](https://github.com/users/nd2003/projects/3) | issues and PRs labeled `team-2` |
| [team-3](https://github.com/users/nd2003/projects/4) | issues and PRs labeled `team-3` |
| [team-4](https://github.com/users/nd2003/projects/5) | issues and PRs labeled `team-4` |
| [platform](https://github.com/users/nd2003/projects/6) | issues and PRs labeled `platform` |
| [All teams](https://github.com/users/nd2003/projects/7) | every issue and PR; filter by team with `label:team-2` etc. |

## Tracking progress

We track progress with GitHub issues and pull requests.

1. **Issue first, then work.** Before you start a piece of work, open an issue:
   - Title starts with your team label: `[team-2] Short description`, `[team-instructor] ...`
   - Describe the **goal** and the **done when** criteria (a short checklist).
   - Add your team label and assign the issue to whoever works on it.
2. **Every pull request closes an issue.** Put `Closes #<issue number>` in the PR description, so the issue is closed automatically when the PR is merged.
   - Every PR follows the template for its type (feature, bug, docs, chore, refactor, release or sync) in [`.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE/`](../.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE/). Don't pick it yourself: `pnpm workflow:classify --kind pr` chooses the template, team label and base branch, the `fill-pr` agent skill fills it in, and `pnpm check:pr` (also run by CI) validates it.
   - Fill in every section, in order, and tick the checklist. Write `None` if a section does not apply. Don't delete or rename the headings: the checks and the evaluation read them.
   - Details: [Templates, classification and checks](../CLAUDE.md#templates-classification-and-checks) in `CLAUDE.md`.
   - The full workflow (branch names, labels, reviews) is in [AGENTS.md](../AGENTS.md).

## Evaluation

At the end of the hackathon the results are evaluated with the help of AI, based on each team's issues, pull requests and commits. The main criteria:

- **Delivery:** how much of what you planned got done (closed issues with merged PRs).
- **Result:** the state of the game: does it run, how complete it is.
- **Process:** clean workflow: clear issues, small PRs, meaningful descriptions.
- **Collaboration:** contributions spread across the team members.

Only work that is visible in this repository counts, so keep your issues and PRs up to date.

**Rules of their time:** every PR is judged by the rules in force when it was opened, and every commit by the rules in force when it was made. A merged PR never needs to be edited, and the rules tightened during the hackathon cost nobody points.

### Checking PR documentation

The evaluation reads the pull requests, so they have to be documented well enough. One command lists, per team, which PRs are not, and why:

```bash
node course/tooling/pr-report.mjs                     # every PR: open, merged and closed
node course/tooling/pr-report.mjs --state open        # only open PRs, to fix gaps during the hackathon
node course/tooling/pr-report.mjs --team team-2       # only one team
node course/tooling/pr-report.mjs --failing           # leave out the passing PRs
node course/tooling/pr-report.mjs --json              # machine-readable, e.g. as input for an AI evaluator
```

It needs the [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com/), logged in with `gh auth login`. The output is Markdown: a pass/fail table per team, then every failing PR with its problems. Paste it into an issue or a chat, or save it with `node course/tooling/pr-report.mjs > pr-report.md`.

A PR passes when all of this is true (the rules from [CLAUDE.md](../CLAUDE.md) and the PR templates):

- The title is in the commit format with the team label as its scope, for example `feat(team-2): add login page`, and the PR has exactly one team label, the same one.
- The branch is named `<team-label>/<issue-number>-<short-description>` and targets the right base branch.
- The description follows its template in `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE/`: every heading is present, in order and filled in, `## Linked issue` has `Closes #N`, `## Team` names the team, and every checklist item is ticked. This part is the same check as `pnpm check:pr --number <N>`.
- The linked issue exists and has the same team label as the PR.
- Every commit references the linked issue on its own line (`Refs #N`). Merge commits are skipped.

Sync and release PRs (from `main`) and integration PRs (`feature/team-N` into `main`) carry several issues, so for them only the template rules are checked.

**Rule eras.** The rules above got stricter during the hackathon. The report judges each PR by the rules in force when it was opened (each commit by when it was made), from the merge time of the PR that introduced them (UTC, 2026-11-06):

| Since | PR | What came in |
|-------|----|--------------|
| 10:47 | #2 | The first workflow rules: `[<team-label>]` title, linked issue, team label on the issue |
| 10:53 | #3 | The PR template and its `## Team` section |
| 11:41 | #18 | The `feature/team-N` branching workflow (base branches) |
| 13:44 | #61 | Typed PR templates and `check:pr`: every heading, the full checklist, branch names, the PR's team label, `Refs #N` in commits |
| 14:29 | #86 | Conventional Commits titles (`feat(team-2): …`); older PRs keep `[team-2] …` |

A problem against a rule from after the PR was opened is listed as *legacy*: shown for information, never counted, neither in this report nor in the student report. A PR passes when it has no current problems.

**Commits that weren't written for the PR.** Two kinds of commits are not checked for `Refs #N`; the report lists them as a warning instead:

- Commits that are already part of an earlier merged PR, for example in a work PR that brings `main` into a team branch. They were judged in their own PR.
- Commits imported from a team's own repository with its history (`IMPORTS` in `course/tooling/lib/pr-report.mjs`: #138 and #280, from team 3's repository). They were written under that repository's rules.

**Exceptions.** If a checklist item can't honestly be ticked, leave it unticked and explain why on the next line, starting with `Exception:`:

```markdown
- [ ] Commits follow Conventional Commits and reference the issue (`Refs #N`)

  Exception: the first two commits were pushed before the review and are kept, as the reviewers asked.
```

The report accepts that item, and also the automatic check behind it (here `Refs #N` in the commits; likewise for the title, branch name, "base branch is correct" and team label items). It still shows the exception, so the reviewer and the evaluation can see it: as a warning on a failing PR, and in the *Passing with an "Exception:" note* block for a PR that passes. "The branch is up to date with its base branch" covers no automatic check: an exception there does not excuse a wrong base branch.

**During the hackathon:** run `node course/tooling/pr-report.mjs --state open --failing` now and then, and fix what it lists (edit the PR description, add the label, retarget the base branch). Commits that are already pushed don't have to be rewritten; reference the issue in the next ones.

**For the evaluation:** run `node course/tooling/pr-report.mjs` once at the end and hand the report (or the `--json` output) to the evaluator together with the issues, PRs and commits. Only current problems count; legacy problems (see *Rule eras* above) are for information. The report still attributes old PRs to their team through the old `[team-N]` prefix. Only the report makes this exception: `pnpm check:pr` and CI always ask for the current rules (for example the commit-format title), so a PR that is still open needs them before it merges.

#### Fixing PRs automatically

```bash
node course/tooling/pr-report.mjs --fix            # dry run: what would change, per PR
node course/tooling/pr-report.mjs --fix --apply    # make the changes on GitHub
```

`--fix` corrects what can be corrected without guessing, on every PR (`--state` and `--team` narrow it down):

- **Open PRs:** adds the missing team label, fixes the title, restructures the description into its template (existing text is moved under the right heading, never removed), adds `Closes #N` from the branch name, sets `## Team`, appends missing checklist items unticked, and retargets the PR to the right base branch. A PR stacked on another work branch is not retargeted.
- **Merged and closed PRs:** only what the evaluation needs to credit the work, and only against the rules of their time: the team label, the title, the linked issue and the team. Their descriptions otherwise stay as they were written. They never get a comment, since their authors can no longer change anything.
- **Titles** follow the rule of the time the PR was opened. A conventional title only gets its scope corrected to the team label. An old `[team-2] …` title on a PR opened before conventional titles (#86) stays as it is. A newer title gets the type its commits agree on, and is left alone if they don't agree.

It never ticks checklist items, writes a summary, test steps or screenshots, or touches commits. What only the author can do is listed in one comment per PR. The next run updates that comment instead of posting a new one, and a run after `--apply` changes nothing. Only open PRs get the comment, and it only lists current problems, never legacy ones.

### Checking issue labels and titles

The evaluation attributes work to teams through the team label and the `[<team-label>]` title prefix of the issues. One command lists, per team, which issues break those rules, and why:

```bash
node course/tooling/issue-report.mjs                  # every issue: open and closed
node course/tooling/issue-report.mjs --state open     # only open issues (also: closed, all)
node course/tooling/issue-report.mjs --team team-2    # only one team
node course/tooling/issue-report.mjs --failing        # leave out the passing issues
node course/tooling/issue-report.mjs --json           # machine-readable, e.g. as input for an AI evaluator
```

It needs the [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com/), logged in with `gh auth login`. The output is Markdown: a pass/fail table per team, then every failing issue with its labels and problems. Paste it into an issue or a chat, or save it with `node course/tooling/issue-report.mjs > issue-report.md`.

An issue passes when both of these are true (the rules from "Issue first" in [CLAUDE.md](../CLAUDE.md), the same ones `pnpm check:issue` enforces):

- It has **exactly one** team label: `team-1`, `team-2`, `team-3`, `team-4`, `platform` or `team-instructor`. Other labels, such as `bug`, are fine.
- Its title starts with `[<team-label>]`, and that prefix is the same as the label (`[team-2]` with the label `team-2`).

An issue is listed under its team label. If it has none or several, it is listed under the team named in its title prefix, and under *(no team)* if there is none. The report only looks at the title and the labels, not the description, because older issues were written before the issue templates existed.

**When to run it:** the instructors run `node course/tooling/issue-report.mjs --state open --failing` at the end of each day, and once more without options before the evaluation. Fix what it lists by adding the missing team label or editing the title, or let `--fix` do it; closed issues can be fixed too. Nothing runs automatically, and without `--fix --apply` nothing is posted to the issues.

#### Fixing issues automatically

```bash
node course/tooling/issue-report.mjs --fix            # dry run: what would change, per issue
node course/tooling/issue-report.mjs --fix --apply    # make the changes on GitHub
```

- **Missing team label:** added when the title prefix names a team, also a malformed one such as `[team : 4]` or `[Team 4]`.
- **Missing or malformed title prefix:** set to `[<team-label>]` when the issue has exactly one team label.
- **Not fixed:** a prefix that names another team than the label, several team labels, or an issue that names no team at all. Which team is right is for the author to say, so on open issues these are listed in a comment, which the next run updates instead of repeating. Closed issues never get a comment.

Run the issue fix before the PR fix: the PR report also checks that the linked issue has the same team label.

### Student activity report

For the instructors, one command scores every student from 1 (weak) to 5 (strong), with the key numbers and a justification:

```bash
node course/tooling/student-report.mjs > .private/student-scores.md
node course/tooling/student-report.mjs --json > .private/student-scores.json   # e.g. as input for an AI evaluator
```

**The output contains individual scores and this repository is public: never commit it.** Keep it in `.private/`, which git ignores. Like the PR report, it needs the GitHub CLI, logged in.

**Team roster.** [`course/teams.json`](teams.json) is the official list of who is in which team, with each student's GitHub login, name and nickname, and the instructors. Everyone can read it; only the instructors change it. The student report uses it: the team comes from the roster (labels are only the fallback for accounts not in it), the instructors are not scored, every student is listed even without activity, and the name, nickname and an optional note are shown. `--roster <path>` reads another file.

The score uses the criteria above that can be measured per person, from 0 to 10 points. *Result* (does the game run) is a team criterion and is not part of it.

| Area | Points | Rule |
|---|---|---|
| **Delivery** | 0–4 | Merged PRs authored: 5 or more → 4, 2–4 → 3, 1 → 2. No merged PR but an open one → 1. |
| **Process** | 0–3 | +1 if at least half of your PRs pass the PR documentation report; +1 if at least 80% of your commits reference an issue (`Refs #N` on its own line); +1 if every issue you opened has a team label and a matching `[team-…]` title. |
| **Collaboration** | 0–3 | Reviewed other people's PRs: 5 or more → 2, 1–4 → 1. +1 for commenting on other people's issues or PRs. |

Points become the score: 0 → **1**, 1–2 → **2**, 3–4 → **3**, 5–7 → **4**, 8–10 → **5**. Instructors, organizer accounts and AI agents are not scored.

Keep in mind when you use it:

- Only work visible on GitHub counts. Pair programming, work on a teammate's machine or unpushed work doesn't show up.
- Commits co-authored by an AI agent (the course is AI first) count for the PR author. A commit that appears in several PRs (work branch → `feature/team-N` → `main`) is counted once.
- Commits imported from a team's own repository (see *Commits that weren't written for the PR* above) are counted separately and left out of the `Refs` rule. The work done there before the import, its issues and reviews, is not scored; take it into account by hand.
- Lines of code are shown for context and are not scored.
- Rules that changed during the hackathon (for example the PR title format) make older PRs fail the documentation report through no fault of the author. Take that into account, as for the PR report.
- Admin work, for example by the repository owner, doesn't show up in issues, PRs or reviews.
