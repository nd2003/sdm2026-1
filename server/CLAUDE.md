# Platform rules (`server/`)

`server/` is the shared platform: the tech stack, infra, CI and tooling that every team's game builds on. It is owned by the **platform team** (label `platform`). The repo-wide rules in [`../CLAUDE.md`](../CLAUDE.md) apply here too; this file adds the platform rules.

## What lives here

| Package | Path | What it is |
|---|---|---|
| `@sdm/core` | `server/core/` | Contract types (`shared`), the sim contract (`sim`), the Simulation and replay runner (`server`), and the client core (`client`) |
| `@sdm/host` | `server/host/` | `startGameServer()` and `createGameRoom()`: the Colyseus + Express host, routes, logs and stats. Room test helpers in `@sdm/host/testing` |
| `@sdm/template` | `server/template/` | Reference game. Teams copy it to `games/team-N/` to start |
| `@sdm/tooling` | `server/tooling/` | Shared TypeScript config (`tsconfig.base.json`) |

Docs for the platform live in `server/ARCHITECTURE.md` and `server/docs/`.

## Rules for teams

- Your game lives in `games/team-N/` and is its own package (`@team-N/game`). Import the platform only through package names: `@sdm/core/shared`, `@sdm/core/sim`, `@sdm/core/server`, `@sdm/core/client`, `@sdm/host`, `@sdm/host/testing`.
- Never import from another team's folder, and never import platform files by relative path (`../../server/...`).
- Need a platform change? Open an issue with the `platform` label that says what your team needs and why. Don't patch `server/` from a team PR.

## Rules for platform changes

- A platform change can break every game, so keep platform PRs small and focused.
- Changes to `server/core/src/shared/` (the contract) are breaking by default. Say in the PR which games are affected and how they migrate.
- `pnpm typecheck` and `pnpm test` run for every workspace package, so a platform PR is only green when every team's game still builds.
- Don't add a dependency to a platform package unless every game benefits. Game-specific dependencies belong in `games/team-N/package.json`.

## Writing a game (the game definition)

Building a client or a game? Read [`docs/CLIENT_GUIDE.md`](docs/CLIENT_GUIDE.md) first: connecting, join by code, reconnect, messages, routes, debugging.

- Put the rules in `games/team-N/shared/game.ts` as a `GameDefinition` from `@sdm/core/sim`. See `server/template/shared/game.ts`.
- The definition and everything in `shared/` must stay browser-safe: import only `@colyseus/schema`, `zod`, `@sdm/core/shared` and `@sdm/core/sim`. Never `colyseus`, `@sdm/host`, `@sdm/core/server` or `node:*`. The client imports it to predict.
- Your state extends `BaseState` (`BaseState.extend({...}, "MyState")`). Don't write `tick`, `code`, `paused` or `seats` yourself; the room base owns them. Read `seats` if you need to know who is connected.
- Your config schema extends `RoomSettingsSchema`, and `config/game.json` sets `tickRate`, `patchRate`, `maxPlayers` and `reconnectSeconds` for your game.
- Register rooms in `room/index.ts` as factories: `{ game: (deps) => createGameRoom(myGame, deps) }`.
- Add game debug commands in `commands` (e.g. `spawn`, `tp`). Built-ins (`pause`, `step`, `timescale`, `seed`, `set`, `kick`) can't be overridden. All of them are recorded in replays and rejected in production.
- Room tests import `boot` from `@sdm/host/testing`, never from `@colyseus/testing` directly, and use their own port.

## Determinism rules (all game code)

Replays only work if the simulation is deterministic:

- Use the room's `SeededRandom` (`@sdm/core/shared`). Never `Math.random()` in simulation code.
- Advance the simulation only in fixed ticks. Never read wall-clock time (`Date.now()`, `performance.now()`) inside the simulation.
- Validate every client message with a zod schema before using it.
- Keep tuning values in `config/*.json`, validated by the game's config schema, so designers change numbers without touching code.

## Setting up a machine

The same steps work on macOS, Windows and Linux. You need only Node, pnpm and (recommended) VS Code. No Docker, no version manager required.

1. Install **Node 22.21.1** or a later 22.x (the exact pin is in `.nvmrc`). nvm and fnm users: `nvm install` or `fnm use --install-if-missing`. Otherwise download it from nodejs.org.
2. Install **pnpm 10.28.0** (pinned by `packageManager` in `package.json`): `corepack enable`, or `npm install -g pnpm@10.28.0`. pnpm 10 switches to the pinned version by itself.
3. Clone the repo and run `pnpm install`. It stops with a clear message if your Node version is wrong.
4. Run `pnpm check:setup`. It checks Node and pnpm versions, that dependencies match the lockfile, LF line endings, file names that differ only by case, and that ports 2567 and 5173 are free. Each failure says how to fix it.
5. Open the repo in VS Code and install the recommended extensions when asked (Biome, EditorConfig). Files are formatted with Biome on save.

Why these rules exist:

- `.gitattributes` keeps LF line endings in every checkout, including on Windows.
- File names that differ only by case (`Player.ts` / `player.ts`) work on macOS and Windows but break on Linux, which is what CI and Railway run.
- Scripts are written in TypeScript or plain Node.js, never bash, so they run on every OS.
- `.vscode/settings.json` and `.vscode/extensions.json` are shared. Keep personal VS Code settings in your user settings; the rest of `.vscode/` is ignored by git.

## Commands (repo root)

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `pnpm install` | Install everything (checks your Node version first) |
| `pnpm check:setup` | Check this machine's setup and explain how to fix problems (`--json` for scripts) |
| `pnpm dev` | Run the template game: server on :2567, client on :5173 |
| `pnpm --filter @team-N/game dev` | Run your team's game |
| `pnpm lint` / `pnpm format` | Biome check / fix (Markdown is excluded) |
| `pnpm typecheck` | TypeScript across every package |
| `pnpm test` | Vitest across every package |
| `pnpm build` | Build every game's client |
| `pnpm workflow:classify --kind issue\|pr\|commit` | Decide the type, team label, template and base branch for a change (`--json` for scripts; see "Templates, classification and checks" in `CLAUDE.md`) |
| `pnpm check:issue` / `pnpm check:pr` / `pnpm check:commit` | Check an issue, a pull request or commit messages against their template or format |
| `pnpm preflight` | Everything a branch must pass before it becomes a PR (see "Preflight" below) |
| `pnpm preflight:quick` | Lint, typecheck and ownership in a few seconds. Agents run it after every change |
| `pnpm labels:sync` | Make the repo's GitHub labels match `server/tooling/workflow/labels.json` (dry run; `--apply` to change) |
| `pnpm labels:prs` | Update every PR's `stackpile` and `waiting-on.*` labels (`--dry-run`, `--number <n>`). The "PR labels" workflow runs it every 10 minutes |

Run `pnpm preflight` before opening a PR. It must pass.

## Preflight

`pnpm preflight` runs, in order: `check:setup`, lint, typecheck, test, build, then the checks below, and prints how to fix every failure. Every check also runs on its own, takes `--json`, and exits with 0 (OK), 1 (problems found), 2 (usage error) or 3 (environment problem, e.g. `gh` not logged in). The branch-level checks compare the current branch with the base the branch model expects; pass `--base <branch>` to override and `--offline` to skip GitHub lookups.

| Check | Fails when |
|---|---|
| `check:branch` | the branch isn't `<team-label>/<issue>-<description>`; it targets the wrong base (team work → `feature/team-N`; platform and instructor work → `main`; `feature/team-N` → `main`; `main` → `prod` or `feature/team-N`); or its issue is missing, closed or has a different label |
| `check:ownership` | a work branch changes files another label owns (`server/tooling/ownership.json`). With a line `Cross-team: <why>` in the issue they are warnings instead |
| `check:commit` | a commit on the branch doesn't follow the commit format (see `CLAUDE.md`) |
| `check:files` | dependencies, build output, `.env` files or files over 1 MB are committed |
| `check:secrets` | an added line looks like a token, private key or hard-coded password |
| `check:docs` | a relative link or heading anchor in any Markdown file is broken |
| `check:config` | a game's `config/game.json` doesn't match the `*ConfigSchema` its `shared/index.ts` exports |
| `check:determinism` | simulation code (`room/`, `shared/`, the server core) calls `Math.random()`, `Date.now()`, `performance.now()` or `new Date()`. A line can opt out with `// determinism-ok: <reason>` |
| `check:contract` | never fails; warns when `server/core/src/shared/` changes, because every game depends on it |

The checks live in `server/tooling/workflow/` with the rest of the workflow toolkit: pure rules in `lib/`, a thin command per check, no runtime dependencies (`check:config` needs `pnpm install`, because it loads each game's schema).

## CI

Every pull request and every push to `main` runs the **CI** checks (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) on Linux, one job per check so a PR shows exactly which one failed: 🧰 setup (`pnpm check:setup --ci`), 📝 config (`pnpm check:config`), 🧹 lint, 🔎 typecheck, 🧪 test and 📦 build, the same commands as above. Each job installs with `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile` through the shared `.github/actions/setup`. Only Linux runs, because every game deploys to Railway, which is Linux. A red check means the PR is not ready for review.

- It covers every package in the workspace, so a platform PR only passes when every team's game still builds.
- `--frozen-lockfile` fails when `pnpm-lock.yaml` is out of date: run `pnpm install` and commit the lockfile.
- Actions are pinned to commit SHAs. Update them through a platform PR.

A second workflow, **Workflow checks** (`.github/workflows/workflow-checks.yml`), runs `pnpm check:pr` and `pnpm check:commit` on every pull request: title, team label, branch and base names, template headings, linked issue, ticked checklist and the commit message format. It also runs the branch-level preflight checks (`check:branch`, `check:ownership`, `check:files`, `check:secrets`, `check:docs`, `check:determinism`, `check:contract`); `ci.yml` runs `check:config` after install. It reruns when the title or description is edited, so fix the text and the check turns green.
