/**
 * Guest identity: a random ID the browser keeps (`getGuestId()` in @sdm/core/client) and sends as the
 * join option `guestId`, so a game can tell that the same person came back.
 *
 * The guest is a hint to recognise a returning player in this game, not authentication: never use it
 * to hand over a seat, a score or ownership. Every game on the shared origin can read the stored ID,
 * and a client can send any UUID (a fresh one to avoid being recognised, or someone else's).
 *
 * The server never puts the raw ID in synced state, logs, replays or HTTP responses. It turns it into a
 * short public fingerprint per game (`guest`: the first 12 hex characters of SHA-256 of
 * `<game id>:<ID>`) and stores only that, so `guest` values can't link one player across games.
