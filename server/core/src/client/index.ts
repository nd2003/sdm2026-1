 * Contents (#13): URL parameters and invite links, per-second meters, the ~ debug overlay with its
 * console, network stats and state inspector, the F8 bug report, network simulation, interpolation
 * buffer, prediction with reconciliation, and the guest ID (getGuestId). The template client (server/template/client) uses all of it.
