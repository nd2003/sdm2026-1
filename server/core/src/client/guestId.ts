 * Guest ID: a random UUID this browser keeps in localStorage, so every tab of a game shares it and it

 *   client.joinById(roomId, { name, guestId: getGuestId() })
 *
 * One key for the whole browser, deliberately not scoped to the game's path: every game on the shared
 * origin reads the same ID, and the server makes the public fingerprint (`seats[sessionId].guest`)
 * different in each game, so players can't be linked across games.
 *
 * It is a hint to recognise a returning player in this game, not a login: other games on the origin
 * can read it and a client can send a fresh one, so never use it to hand over a seat, score or
 * ownership. The server never stores or shows the raw ID; don't log it, put it in a URL or a bug
 * report, or show it to players either.
